#summary API Reference for Theme developers

= Introduction =

When creating your theme templates, certain php variables will be made available to you by Sweetcron.  This document tells you what those variables are.

= Config-Level Variables =

These variables enable you to get information about Sweetcron configuration such as the title of the lifestream etc.

=== $this->config->item('base_url') ===

Returns the full url of Sweetcron's base url

=== $this->config->item('lifestream_title') ===

Returns the title of the lifestream.

= Page-Level Variables =

These are variables that are available to individual theme pages.

=== $page_name ===

Returns the name of the current page (e.g. "Item Search" or "Items")

=== $popular_tags ===

An array of popular tags in your Sweetcron install.  Each tag object looks like this:

{{{
$tag->name //the human readable tag name
$tag->slug //the lowercase, alphanumeric slug to be used in tag searches
$tag->count //the total number of items with this tag
}}}

So you can use $popular_tags to create a lis of popular tags in your theme templates, like this:

{{{
<?php foreach ($popular_tags as $tag): ?>
<?php echo $tag->name?>
<?php endforeach; ?>
}}}

=== $tags ===

The same as above, except this array contains all available tags in your Sweetcron install.

=== $items ===

An array of item objects for the current page, whether you are on the index page, an item search page, an item tag page etc etc.  See $item Object documentation below for full API reference.  Usage example:

{{{
<?php foreach ($items as $item): ?>
<?php echo $item->get_title()?>
<?php endforeach; ?>
}}}

= The $item Object =
